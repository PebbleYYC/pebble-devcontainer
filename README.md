# 🚀 Pebble Developer Tools in a Containerized Environment

This repository provides a **containerized** development setup for [Pebble](https://rebble.io/), enabling an isolated and portable environment for Pebble SDK development. It supports both **Docker Compose** and **VS Code Dev Containers**, making it easy to get started with minimal setup.

Happy coding! 🚀🎉

### 🖥️ Emulator Notes

#### **Windows Users**

- You have **two options**:
  1. **Use WSL2**, which includes native X11 forwarding when running GUI applications.
  2. **Alternatively**, use an X server like [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/) or [Xming](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/) if running Docker natively on Windows (outside WSL2).

#### **Linux Users (X11 and Wayland)**

- **X11 Users:** The container should automatically detect and use your X server if `DISPLAY` is set.
- **Wayland Users:** The container should automatically detect and use your Wayland session if `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is set.

#### **Mac Users (XQuartz Required)**

- Install and launch **XQuartz**:
  ```sh
  brew install --cask xquartz
  ```
- Restart your session or log out and back in after installing XQuartz.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before setting up the environment, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) – Required to run containers
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) & [Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) (Optional) – For using Dev Containers
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) – To clone the repository

## 🚀 1. Setting Up with Docker Compose (Recommended)

This method provides the easiest and most streamlined way to run the Pebble development environment.

### **Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/FBarrCa/pebble-devcontainer.git
   cd pebble-dev-container
   ```

2. **Start the container:**

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the container shell:**

   ```sh
    docker exec -it pebble-sdk-container zsh
   ```

4. **Stop and remove the container when done:**
   ```sh
   docker compose down
   ```

## 🖥️ 2. Setting Up with VS Code Dev Containers

If you're using **VS Code**, you can leverage **Dev Containers** to automatically set up and launch the environment inside a container.

### **Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/FBarrCa/pebble-devcontainer.git
   cd pebble-dev-container
   ```

2. **Open VS Code and load the project folder.**

3. When prompted, **click "Reopen in Container"**.

4. Wait for the container to build and start—then you're ready to code!
